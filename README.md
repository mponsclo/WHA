# World Happiness Dataset Analysis

Academic projects analyzing the World Happiness Report datasets using multivariate statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

## About

These projects were developed as final coursework for the Machine Learning and Multivariate Analysis courses of the Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics at UPC (Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya).

The analysis focuses on the World Happiness Report for 2018 and 2019, applying advanced statistical and machine learning methods to understand patterns in global happiness data.

## Dataset

The [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) is a landmark survey that ranks 156 countries by happiness scores based on citizen perceptions. The datasets include features such as:

- **Happiness Score** - Target variable representing perceived happiness
- **GDP per capita** - Economic prosperity indicator
- **Social support** - Availability of social networks
- **Healthy life expectancy** - Health and longevity metrics
- **Freedom to make life choices** - Personal autonomy measures
- **Generosity** - Charitable giving patterns
- **Perceptions of corruption** - Trust in institutions

**Data Sources:**
- [Kaggle - World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- [data.world - World Happiness Report 2019](https://data.world/promptcloud/world-happiness-report-2019)

## Project Structure

- `Machine_Learning.Rmd` - Machine learning analysis including PCA, clustering, and predictive modeling
- `Multivariate_analysis.Rmd` - Multivariate statistical analysis with exploratory data analysis
- `WHR2018.csv` - World Happiness Report 2018 dataset
- `WHR2019.csv` - World Happiness Report 2019 dataset
- `Machine Learning Report.pdf` - Generated report from machine learning analysis
- `Mva_Report.pdf` - Generated report from multivariate analysis

## Methods Applied

### Multivariate Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Cluster Analysis (K-means, EM clustering)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Dimensionality reduction techniques

### Machine Learning
- Linear regression with regularization
- Decision trees and random forests
- Neural networks
- Cross-validation and model evaluation
- Performance metrics analysis

## Requirements

The analysis is implemented in R and requires the following packages:

```r
# Data manipulation and analysis
library(dplyr)
library(mice)
library(psych)

# Visualization
library(ggplot2)
library(gplots)
library(tableplot)

# Multivariate analysis
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)
library(chemometrics)

# Machine learning
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(neuralnet)
library(glmnet)
```

## Usage

1. Open the R Markdown files in RStudio
2. Install required packages if not already available
3. Run the code chunks or knit the entire document to generate reports

```r
# Render the documents
rmarkdown::render("Machine_Learning.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("Multivariate_analysis.Rmd")
```
